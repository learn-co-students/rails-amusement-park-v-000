That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.

  41) Feature Test: Admin Flow links to attraction/edit page from attraction/show page when logged in as an admin
      Failure/Error: visit '/users/new'

      ActionController::UnknownFormat:
        UsersController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

        request.formats: ["text/html"]
        request.variant: []

        NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.
